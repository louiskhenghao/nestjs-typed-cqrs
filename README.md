# nestjs-typed-cqrs

`NestJs` provides a lightweight `CQRS` (https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/cqrs) module.

But we have taken it a step further by implementing coding practices that utilize [TypedCqrs](https://github.com/nestjs-architects/typed-cqrs) alongside [CQRS](https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/cqrs). This enhances the developer experience by allowing them to focus on writing business logic while reducing the likelihood of errors.
